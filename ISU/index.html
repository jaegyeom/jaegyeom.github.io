		    <p>The equation above is known as the Euler's Identity. It is considered one of the most beautiful equation in mathematics.</p>
		    <br>
		    <p>Now, let's take a quick look at this</p>
		    <img src="infinite_series.png" width="175">
		    <p>Unlike Euler's Identity, mathematicians rated this formula as ugly.</p>
		    <br>
		    <p>This was an experiment conducted at University College London.</p>
		    <p>It turns out, when mathematicians see the formulas rated as beautiful the emotional part of their brain 
		    activates! And the pattern was pretty consistent.</p>
        	    <br>
		    <p>But... why?</p>
		    <p>Isn't beauty a subjective concept? How could something so abstract as Math be beautiful?</p>
		    <h2>Mathematical Beauty</h2>
		    <p>Let's talk about Mathematical beauty now. When Mathematicians say something is beautiful, it means that concept has certain <b>Properties</b>.</p>
		    <p>Those are:</p> <ul>
			<li>Clarity of the central idea and its structure</li>
			<li>Simplicity of the methods</li>
			<li>Capability of imagination</li>
		    </ul>
		    <p>Mathematicians are "fans" of the same genre. Although it's true that beauty is a subjective concept, the judgement of 
		    mathematical beauty is surprisingly similar.</p>
		    <p><b>Mathematicians love this abstractness of mathematics.</b></p>
		    
		    <h2>The Importance</h2>
		    <p>So why even care about mathematical beauty? Why is it so important</p>
		    <p>For Mathematicians, it's <b>motivation</b>. Mathematical beauty is the motivation behind all Mathematician.</p>

		    <p>For non-Mathematicians, finding mathematical beauty positively impact their mathematical view, which overall 
		    motivates them to explore the subject deeper.</p>
		    
		    <h2>How to find mathematical beauty</h2>
		    <p>The beauty of mathematics can be found during the process of succinct approach to a problem or when an exciting breakthrough in a problem is made.</p>
